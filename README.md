# Unreachable Code in Julia
This repository demonstrates an example of unreachable code in a Julia function. The function `myfunction` contains a `return` statement in both branches of an `if-else` block and a final return statement that will never be reached. This can lead to unexpected behavior or confusion, and is generally a sign of a logic error.

The `bug.jl` file contains the code with the error, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version. This example highlights the importance of careful code structuring and avoiding redundant or unnecessary return statements.
